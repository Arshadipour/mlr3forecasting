For assessment of performance of a learning algorithm .......

Example: 
```r
l = LearnerForecast$new(id = "my_id", some_parameter = 0.5)

l$train(task, row_ids = train_set)

prediction = l
$predict(task, row_ids = test_set)

```



## Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

Internally, the function would look the following:

Example: 
```r
ResamplingCV = R6Class("ResamplingCV", inherit = Resampling,
  public = list(
    initialize = function() {
      ps = ParamSet$new(list(
        ParamInt$new("folds", lower = 1L, tags = "required")
      ))
      ps$values = list(folds = 10L)

      super$initialize(id = "cv", param_set = ps, man = "mlr3::mlr_resamplings_cv")
    }
  ),

  active = list(
    iters = function() {
      as.integer(self$param_set$values$folds)
    }
  ),

  private = list(
    .sample = function(ids) {
      data.table(
        row_id = ids,
        fold = shuffle(seq_along0(ids) %% as.integer(self$param_set$values$folds) + 1L),
        key = "fold"
      )
    },

    .get_train = function(i) {
      self$instance[!list(i), "row_id", on = "fold"][[1L]]
    },

    .get_test = function(i) {
      self$instance[list(i), "row_id", on = "fold"][[1L]]
    },

    .combine = function(instances) {
      rbindlist(instances, use.names = TRUE)
    },

    deep_clone = function(name, value) {
      if (name == "instance") copy(value) else value
    }
  )
)

#' @include mlr_resamplings.R
mlr_resamplings$add("cv", ResamplingCV)
```


## Rationale, drawbacks and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

This design seems fairly obvious choice in the design space.
The main alternative to this proposal is not to implement it,
and let users to calculate joined subslices from indexes or pointers.

## Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

There exists a function that implements the API as here...

## Introduced Dependencies 
This solution would introduce dependencies on the following (additional) packages:

Those packages either depend on or import the following other (additional) packages:

Using this package would allow us to ... instead of re-implementing and maintining
N loc ourselves.
